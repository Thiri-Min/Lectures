## 🎯 Learning Methodology

### 1. Learn by Doing
- Always combine theory with hands-on practice
- Write code, build small features, and test ideas immediately
- Mistakes are part of the learning process — fix them, don’t fear them

---

### 2. Start Simple, Then Go Deeper
- Begin with fundamentals before advanced concepts
- Avoid jumping directly into frameworks without understanding basics
- Master core ideas first (syntax, logic, flow)

---

### 3. Practice Consistently
- Short daily practice (30–60 minutes) is better than long, irregular sessions
- Review previous lessons before starting new ones
- Repetition builds confidence and muscle memory

---

### 4. Ask “Why”, Not Just “How”
- Understand **why** something works, not just how to write it
- Explore edge cases and alternative solutions
- Read error messages carefully and learn from them

---

### 5. Use Documentation Effectively
- Learn how to read official documentation
- Don’t memorize everything — know where to find answers
- Use trusted resources (official docs, MDN, GitHub README files)

---

### 6. Build Mini Projects
- Apply knowledge through small projects
- Focus on functionality first, then improve design and structure
- Push projects to GitHub to track progress and growth

---

### 7. Reflect and Improve
- After completing a topic, summarize what you learned
- Identify weak areas and revisit them
- Keep notes or markdown files for future reference

---
