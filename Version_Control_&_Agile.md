# Version Control & Agile in Project Work

## 1. Introduction
Modern software development requires both **technical discipline** and **collaborative practices**.  
Two essential components are:
- **Version Control Systems (VCS)**: Tools like Git that track changes in code.
- **Agile Methodology**: A flexible, iterative approach to project management.

When integrated into project work, these practices ensure students learn not only how to code, but also how to collaborate effectively.

## 2. Version Control Basics
- **Definition**: A system that records changes to files over time.
- **Key Features**:
  - Track history of code changes.
  - Collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.
  - Roll back to previous versions if needed.
- **Common Tools**: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Repository (repo)
  - Commit
  - Branch
  - Merge
  - Pull Request

## 3. Agile Fundamentals
- **Definition**: A project management methodology emphasizing adaptability and collaboration.
- **Core Principles**:
  - Deliver working software frequently.
  - Respond to change over following a rigid plan.
  - Encourage collaboration between developers and stakeholders.
- **Practices**:
  - Sprints (short development cycles)
  - Daily stand-ups
  - Backlog management
  - Retrospectives

## 4. Integration into Project Work
- **Early Introduction**: Students learn Git basics before starting the project.
- **Continuous Use**:
  - Every code change is committed and pushed to a shared repository.
  - Branching strategies (feature branches, main branch) are applied.
- **Agile in Action**:
  - Project divided into sprints.
  - Students hold stand-up meetings to discuss progress and blockers.
  - Backlog items (features, bugs) tracked in tools like Jira, Trello, or GitHub Projects.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Pull requests reviewed by peers.
  - Agile ceremonies (planning, retrospectives) embedded into project milestones.

---

## 5. Benefits for Students
- **Practical Skills**: Learn industry-standard tools (Git, Agile boards).
- **Teamwork**: Practice collaboration and communication.
- **Adaptability**: Gain experience in iterative development.
- **Professional Readiness**: Prepare for real-world software engineering environments.

---

## 6. Summary
By integrating **Version Control** and **Agile** into project work:
- Students don’t just learn coding—they learn *how to work like professional developers*.  
- These practices ensure projects are organized, collaborative, and reflective of industry standards.
